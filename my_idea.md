# Crossref

This open source software offers free anonymus scholarly metadata. It is always "tricky"to provide full anonimity so crossref stores the IP address of the data for 90 days and then deletes it. 
"The best we can do is make sure that some people who have the need for extra precautions can access the API without needing to authenticate or explicitly identify themselves" (https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc/blob/master/api_tips.md)
The package being free sometimes causes problems and the creaters are aware of them, there is an option for self- identifying with providing contact information.
The weakness of crossref is that it depends on the people using it, registering and sharing their own work.
